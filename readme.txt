This project is an experamentation in generative neural networks. The end goal is to generate images from scratch based off of a pool of other images. Never done this before. We'll see what comes of it.

ðŸ—¸ subproject 0.00: Download TensorFlow and other necessary packages and get them working
ðŸ—¸ subproject 0.10: Follow a tutorial for classification neural network to get back into using TensorFlow.
â€¢ subproject 0.11: Go through MIT's 6.S191 Introduction to Deep Learning course to really understand the priniples behind all this.
â€¢ subproject 0.12: Learn the basics of TensorFlow
â€¢ subproject 0.13: Design and build my own classification neural network to apply the skills I learned in 0.11 and 0.12.
â€¢ subproject 0.20: Make a GAN that generates handwritten digits based off the MNIST dataset
â€¢ subproject 0.30: Make a GAN that generates faces off of theÂ CelebA dataset "https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset#000004.jpg"
â€¢ subproject 0.40: Create my own dataset of faces or quotes (like IAN suggested)
â€¢ project 1.00: Make a GAN using my own dataset
